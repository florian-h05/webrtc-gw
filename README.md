# webrtc-sip-gw

A [SIP over WebSocket](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7118) - [SIP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261) gateway for the AVM Fritz!Box based on [Kamailio](https://www.kamailio.org/w/) and [rtpengine](https://github.com/sipwise/rtpengine).

This gateway allows any SIP user of your Fritz!Box to perform calls with SIP over WebSocket, which is unsupported by the Fritz!Box.

## Important Information

The domain of the SIP server is “hard-coded” to `fritz.box`.

To connect to the SIP over WebSocket from mobile clients like Android & iOS, it is required that you use TLS.
webrtc-sip-gw will enable it’s internal TLS by default and therefore requires a certificate, but you can disable the internal TLS if you want to use a proxy like nginx instead.

### Internal TLS

Unless internal TLS is not explicitly disabled, TLS certificate and private key are required at these (container internal) paths:

- certificate: `/etc/ssl/fullchain.pem`
- private key: `/etc/ssl/privkey.pem`

The provided `docker-compose` file includes mounts for these two files.

### nginx Reverse Proxy

Instead of using the internal TLS and therefore needing to provide a certificate, you can use an existing nginx reverse proxy.

Just add this `location` block to a valid `server` configuration:

```
    location /sip {
        proxy_pass                    http://127.0.0.1:8090; # Adjust to your webrtc-sip-gw Docker host's IP
        proxy_http_version            1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade      $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection   "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout            86400;
    }
```

### Ports

SIP over WebSocket is exposed on TCP ports 8090 (unsecured) and, if internal TLS is enabled, 4443 (secured).
Additionally, UDP ports 23400-23500 are exposed by rtpengine.

If you use any firewall, these ports need to be open!

## Container Setup Guide

### Directory & Docker Compose File

Create a new directory on your Docker host and place the [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) there.

If you want to disable the internal TLS, set the value of the `TLS_DISABLE` environment variable in the `docker-compose` file to `true`:

Unless you have not explicitly disabled TLS:

- `cd` into the new directory.
- Create a `ssl` folder.

### Certificate

The certificate should be placed in the `ssl` directory and named `sipgw.crt`.
The private key should also be placed on the `ssl` directory and named `sipgw.key`.

The certificate needs to be installed and trusted on your clients.

You can either use a certificate from a (public or private) CA or generate your own self-signed certificate.

#### Using OpenSSL to Generate Self-Signed Certificates

OpenSSL is packaged for most Linux distributions, installing it should be as simple as:

```shell
sudo apt install openssl
```

OpenSSL can be told to generate a 2048 bit long RSA key and a certificate that is valid for 825 days, but there are some important requirements:
- You have any hostname for the CN (common name) of the certificate. Enter this hostname when OpenSSL asks for `Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:`. It is not required that the server can be reached under this hostname, but the certificate must have a hostname as CN.
- Replace `<IP-ADDRESS>` with your server's IP address.
- Replace `<ADDITIONAL-HOSTNAME>` with another hostname the certificate should be valid for, or delete `,DNS:<ADDITIONAL-HOSTNAME>`.
```shell
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 825 -newkey rsa:2048 -addext 'subjectAltName=IP:<IP-ADDRESS>,DNS:<ADDITIONAL-HOSTNAME>' -addext 'keyUsage = digitalSignature,keyEncipherment' -addext 'extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth' -keyout ./ssl/sipgw.key -out ./ssl/sipgw.crt
```

This certificate follows the [Requirements for trusted certificates in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210176).
Key usage and extended key usage are set as defined in [RFC5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12).

You will be prompted for some information which you will need to fill out for the certificate, please remember to fill in a hostname when it asks for Common Name.

### Container Start-Up

Execute the following:

```shell
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

The following error messages can be ignored during startup:

```text
ERROR: rtpengine [rtpengine.c:2887]: send_rtpp_command(): can’t send command „ping“ to RTPEngine <udp:127.0.0.1:22222>
ERROR: rtpengine [rtpengine.c:2788]: rtpp_test(): proxy did not respond to ping
```

## Client Setup Guide

#### Install & Trust Certificate on Clients

Copy the `sipgw.crt` (only this file, not the key!) to your clients and open the file.

On Android and Windows, a popup with a certificate installation wizard should open up.

On iOS/iPadOS, a popup that tells you to visit the settings should open up.
Visit the settings as told and proceed.

#### openHAB MainUI Setup

Using the [`oh-sipclient`](https://openhab.org/docs/ui/components/oh-sipclient.html) component or widget, use the following configuration:

- `websocketUrl`: `wss://YOUR-DOCKER-HOST:4443`
- `domain`: `fritz.box`
- `username`: any valid SIP user in your Fritz!Box
- `password`: password of your valid SIP user
